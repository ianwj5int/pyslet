class URI(PEP8Compatibility):

    r"""Class to represent URI References

        You won't normally instantiate a URI directly as it represents a
        less powerful generic URI.  This class is designed to be
        overridden by scheme-specific implementations.  Use the class
        method :meth:`from_octets` to create instances.

        Unless otherwise stated, all attributes use binary strings
        comprised of octets (bytes) which are defined as URI
        'characters' in the specification.  They are typically
        represented by their corresponding characters in the US ASCII
        character set.

        URIs can be converted to strings (of bytes) using str but not
        unicode strings (see below).  The string form is used in
        comparisons.

        The reason for this restriction is best illustrated with an
        example:

        The URI %E8%8B%B1%E5%9B%BD.xml is a UTF-8 and URL-encoded path
        segment using the Chinese word for United Kingdom.  When we
        remove the URL-encoding we get the string
        '\\xe8\\x8b\\xb1\\xe5\\x9b\\xbd.xml' which must be interpreted
        with utf-8 to get the intended path segment value:
        u'\\u82f1\\u56fd.xml'. However, if the URL was marked as being a
        unicode string of characters then this second stage would not be
        carried out and the result would be the unicode string
        u'\\xe8\\x8b\\xb1\\xe5\\x9b\\xbd', which is a meaningless string
        of 6 characters taken from the European Latin-1 character
        set."""

            of just a fragment both refer to the current document.  By
            default, *current_doc_ref* is assumed to be the same as
            *base* but there are cases where the base URI is not the
            same as the URI used to originally retrieve the document and
            this optional parameter allows you to cope with those cases.

        because B is the base URI from which U has been derived::

            U [/] B = undefined if B is more specified than U

            /HD/User/setting.txt = /HD/folder/file.txt [*] ../User/setting.txt

        And for relative paths::

            U = User/setting.txt
            B = User/folder/file.txt

            User/setting.txt [\] User/folder/file.txt = ../setting.txt
